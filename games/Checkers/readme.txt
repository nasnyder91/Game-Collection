<strong>Players</strong>: 2<br/><br/>

<strong>Rules</strong>: Players choose either red or white.  White goes first.  Players take turns moving their pieces.
Pieces can only move on a diagonal on the black squares.  Single pieces can only move towards the opponents side.  Players can jump
another players piece and remove it from the board.  Reaching the other side of the board creates a king with that piece.  A king can move forward
and backwards and can jump in either direction also.  First player to eliminate all of the opponents pieces wins.
